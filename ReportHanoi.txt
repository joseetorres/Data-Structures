1.Name of algorithm 
Towers of Hanoi
O(2^N)

Theoretical O() function
2^n-1

2. Comparison of theoretical O() and measured time = F(N)

F(20) = .008 
F(21) = .014
F(22) = .022

3.Description of how how you measured time. Describe how
   much variation there was between different runs for same N.
Testing 21 disks using time ./a.out
	
	1st run|2nd run|3rd run
Real	.045s	.043s	.042s
User	.016s	.015s	.012s
System	.000s	.001s	.002s

The program was tested using time. The average of the 3 runs was .014s. The variations were not that far apart. The highest value was .016s while the lowest was .012s. 

4. Conclusion  (does theoretical O() match measured F()?
   if it doesn't, speculate why not).
In the theory for every increment of N the time should double. From F(20) to F(21) the time nearly doubled. From F(21) to F(22) it ran a little faster then expected. Clearly from F(20) to F(21) one can see the results do double matching with the theory.
