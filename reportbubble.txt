1.Name of algorithm & Theoretical O() function
Bubble Sort
O(N^2)

2. Comparison of theoretical O() and measured time = F(N)

F(5000) = .080s
F(10000) = .326s
F(20000) = .1.349s

3.Description of how how you measured time. Describe how
   much variation there was between different runs for same N.
Testing N = 5000 using time ./a.out
	
	1st run|2nd run|3rd run
Real	.123s	.132s	.131s
User	.082s	.078s	.080s
System	.002s	.002s	.001s

The program was tested using time. The average of the 3 runs was .080s. The variations were not that far apart. The highest value was .082s while the lowest was .078s. 

4. Conclusion  (does theoretical O() match measured F()?
  
In the theory for every increment of 1000 the time should double. From F(5000) to F(10000) the time increased by 4x. From F(10000) to F(20000) it ran a little more then expected but ran close. Clearly from F(20) to F(21) one can see the results do increase 10x matching with the theory.
